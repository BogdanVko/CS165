     * The Move class represents the action of moving one disc between pegs.
     * Of course, if that disc is covered by other discs, you'll first have
     * to move them off. And after the original disc is moved over, you'll
     * want to put the other discs back on top.
     * <p>
     * You will need the following fields:
     * <ol>
     *     <li> A field to hold the disc number
     *     <li> Three fields for the to/from/auxiliary pole numbers
     *     <li> A field to tell you whether the disc is covered by smaller discs
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The last field doesn't have a direct analog to the recursive implementation.
     * However, before the first recursive call the disc in question was covered by
     * a tower of smaller discs. After that recursive call returns, the disc
     * is uncovered and can be moved. Then the second recursive call moved the smaller
     * discs back on top of it.
     * <p>
     * In the recursive version, the runtime stack keeps track of where in the method to
     * jump back to when the recursive call returned, this effectively keeps a bit of state
     * about how far along the computation is.
     * <p>
     * In the iterative version, we have to store this information explicitly in the object:
     * is the disc covered (and will require work before it can be moved) or is it now
     * uncovered (and ready to be moved before finally moving the smaller discs back
     * on top).

     * The recursive solution for Towers of Hanoi. <br>

     *     <li> The base case for the recursion is to return if asked to move disc 0.
     *     <li> Make a recursive call to move the stack above the current disc from the source to the auxiliary pole.
     *          For example, if the current disk is 5, you would want to recurse with disk 4 and the appropriate
     *          arguments.
     *     <li> Now the discs above are out of the way, {@link TowersOfHanoi#move(int, int, int)}
     *          the requested disc to the destination pole.
     *     <li> Make a recursive call to move the stack on the auxiliary pole back to the destination pole.
     * </ol>
     * Verify that your solution works by running the program using the recursive option.
     * @param disc the disc you are moving to the destination (auxiliary) pole.
     * @param from the pole that the disk is currently on
     * @param aux the auxiliary pole (provides supplementary or additional help) but won't be used to move this disk
     *            at this point of time.
     * @param to the pole that the disk will move to

     *                            out of the way (onto the auxiliary). This is the analog of the first
